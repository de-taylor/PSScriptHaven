# Welcome to de-taylor's PowerShell Script Haven

Greetings and salutations to you, O Champion of Automation! Thank you for visiting my humble haven.
Here, as in many other places on the internet, you may find the answers you seek. Or not, I'm not omniscient.

This is a collection of PowerShell scripts that I've put together to solve one problem or another. The solutions
will not be perfect, and I guarantee there are faster and more elegant ways to do everything I code. The only time
I ever write scripts are when I can't find those faster and more elegant ways already written, so here we are.

Feel free to use any script I put in part or whole, I make no claim to their originality nor do I seek to profit
from their distribution. And please, if you see a glaring flaw and know how to fix it, let me know somehow, I'm
all about Admins Helping Admins.

Enjoy!
